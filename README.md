#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
 3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
 4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology each phase of the project must be completed before the next one begins. The typical phases include Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance; for instance Large-scale construction or engineering projects where sequential work is necessary while in Agile methodology, it focuses on collaboration among cross-functional teams and adapting to changes throughout the project lifecycle; for instance projects in fast-changing environments or those with evolving requirements, such as software startups or tech products where user needs are unclear.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A sotftware developer creates software solutions based on project requirements by writing code and developing features.
A Quality Assurance Engineer develops and executes test cases to ensure the software meets quality standards.
A Project Manager defines scope, objectives, deliverables, and timelines; develops project plans and schedules.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) and Version Control Systems (VCS) provides software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Unclear requirements which can lead to incorrect implementations and project delays. The solution is to work with stakeholders to document requirements clearly and in detail as well as regularly communicate with stakeholders and ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding.
2. Complexity in codebase which happens as the projects grow, the codebase can become complex and hard to manage, increasing the risk of bugs and making changes difficult. The solution is to enforce coding standards and best practices to maintain consistency.
   
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit:tests individual units or components of the software in isolation, such as functions, methods, or classes.
Integration:tests the interactions between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected.
System:tests the complete and integrated software system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance:verifies that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery. Often conducted by the end-users or clients. 

Importance of the various types of testing is that each type plays a specific role in the software development lifecycle, contributing to the overall quality assurance process by addressing different aspects of functionality, integration, and user acceptance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a technique used to design and craft effective prompts or queries for interacting with AI models.

The importance of prompt engineering is well-crafted prompts help ensure that the AI generates responses that are more relevant and accurate as well as users can interact with AI models more effectively

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: I need a recipe on baking with flour.
Improved prompt: I need a recipe on baking a sponge cake using flour.

The improved prompt is more effective because my query was concise.
